- DevOps = culture + practices to reduce friction between dev and ops
- SDLC stages: plan -> build -> test -> release -> deploy -> operate -> monitor
- CI = automatically build/test on every change
- CD = deploy changes frequently and safely
- Feedback loops: monitoring/alerts -> issues -> improvements
